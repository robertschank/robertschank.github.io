Feeling misaligned in life is... not great.

I've experimented with practices from [Julia Cameron](https://juliacameronlive.com/), [Byron Katie](https://thework.com/), [Dick Schwartz](https://ifs-institute.com/), [Martha Beck](https://marthabeck.com/), and others—attempting a life that felt like my own.

After some issues with actually doing the work, I realized it helped to minimize decisions.

This is my attempt at distilling their work into a life-friendly tool: three core practices and a group, because we seem to do better together.

It's simple on the surface, meant to work with busy lives. The depth comes from showing up consistently and letting the practices do their thing. This is what I'm using today, and what I wish I had when I started.

If you're interested in working towards authenticity—maybe it's for you.
