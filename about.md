Feeling misaligned in life is... not great.

I've worked with practices from Julia Cameron, Byron Katie, Dick Schwartz, Martha Beck, Gabor Maté, and others—trying to move towards a life that felt like my own.

This is my attempt at distilling that work into something accessible: three core practices, and a group, because we seem to do better together.

It's simple on the surface, meant to work into busy lives. The depth comes from showing up consistently and letting the practices do their thing. This is what I wish I had when I started—and what I use today.

If you're interested in working towards authenticity—this might be for you.

* Three exercises (free—they're not mine)
* Weekly Sunday meetings (free)
