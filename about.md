Feeling misaligned in life is... not great.

I've experimented with practices from [Julia Cameron](https://juliacameronlive.com/), [Byron Katie](https://thework.com/), [Dick Schwartz](https://ifs-institute.com/), [Martha Beck](https://marthabeck.com/), and others—working towards a life that felt more like my own.

After some issues with actually doing the work, I found it helpful to minimize decisions.

So this is my attempt at distilling their work into a life-friendly tool: three core practices and a group, because we seem to do better together.

The exercises are simple, the depth comes from showing up and letting them do their thing. This is what I use, and what I wish I had when I started.

If you're interested in working towards authenticity—maybe it's for you.
