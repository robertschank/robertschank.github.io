Feeling misaligned is an interesting problem.

After self-experimenting with the contributions of — in my opinion — leaders in the field, this is my attempt at a “one pager” roadmap for working on it.

Which happens to involve journaling.

And a group to check-in.

It’s a work in progress.

If you’re interested in working towards authenticity—this might be for you
