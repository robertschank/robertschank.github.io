Feeling misaligned in life is... it's not great.

I've experimented with practices from [Julia Cameron](https://juliacameronlive.com/), [Byron Katie](https://thework.com/), [Dick Schwartz](https://ifs-institute.com/), [Martha Beck](https://marthabeck.com/), and others—working towards a life that felt more like my own.

After some resistance with actually doing the work, I found it helpful to minimize decisions.

So this is my attempt at distilling their work into a life-friendly tool: three core practices and a group, because we seem to do better together.

It's simple, meant to work with busy lives. The depth comes from showing up consistently and letting the practices do their thing. This is what I use, and what I wish I had when I started.

If you're interested in working towards authenticity—maybe it's for you.

Why journaling?

Because. It's an act of pulling some esoteric swirling notions down concretely with ink and paper. Ink and paper --> art --> you get it.
