Feeling misaligned in life is... not great.

I've experimented with practices from [Julia Cameron](https://juliacameronlive.com/), [Byron Katie](https://thework.com/), [Dick Schwartz](https://ifs-institute.com/), [Martha Beck](https://marthabeck.com/), and others—working towards a life that felt more like my own.

<!-- After some issues with actually doing the work, I found it helpful to minimize the decision making. -->

So this is my attempt at distilling their work into a life-friendly tool: three core practices and a group, because we seem to do better together.

It's simple, meant to jive with busy lives. The depth comes from showing up consistently and letting the practices do their thing. <!--This is what I use, and what I wish I had when I started.-->

If you're interested in working towards authenticity—maybe it's for you.

Why journaling?

I don't love journaling, but it seems to work. Catching the action on paper can make it easier to see what we're working with.
