## <a id="morning-pages-full"></a> Morning Pages
**Julia Cameron, The Artist's Way**

**Context:** Morning Pages is a daily writing practice designed to clear mental clutter and access creativity. There's no technique to master‚Äîjust write whatever comes up.

**Good for:**
- Relief from intrusive thoughts
- Unlocking creativity and new ideas
- Building a regular creative practice without perfectionism or self-judgment

**Spice Level:** üå∂Ô∏è Mild

**Entry Point:** Stream of consciousness

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 

### How it works:

- **Aim for three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing**

- **Before you start your day** - Give your "monkey mind" thoughts a place to exist on the paper. Maybe they'll leave you alone.

- **Write whatever comes:** Petty complaints, to-do lists, dreams, worries, random observations. This is meant to be messy and unfiltered. This is a chance for you to accept anything your mind comes up with. There's no bad art here.

- **Keep the pen moving** - Try not to stop to edit or think. Allow your mind to slow down to match the speed of the pen, and relay whatever comes up onto the paper. If you're stuck, write about being stuck until something else emerges.

## <a id="four-questions-full"></a> Four Questions
**Byron Katie, Loving What Is**

**Context:** We suffer when we argue with reality. The four questions help you stop fighting what is and find clarity in what's actually true.

**Good for:**
- Release from troubling thoughts
- Calling yourself out on your stories
- Exploring how the internal and external reflect each other

**Spice Level:** üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è Medium

**Entry Point:** Negative thoughts

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 

### Steps:

**Settle in** - Find a quiet space. Let your mind settle (as much as it will).

**Pick a thought** - Start by pointing your finger outward. Choose a statement about someone or something that's bothering you: "Charlie doesn't respect me,"  "My boss is unfair." Don't start with yourself ("I'm not good enough")‚Äîthat comes later.

**Write it down simply** ‚Äî as few words as possible while keeping the original meaning

#### The Four Questions
1. **Is it true?** - Yes or no answers only. Sit with it for a moment if you're answering with more than a yes or a no.

1. **Can you absolutely know that it's true?** - Can you know with absolute certainty?

1. **How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?** - Notice everything. How does it feel in your body? How do you treat yourself and others? What images play in your mind? Stay on your original thought, don't let your mind take off on a new one.

1. **Who would you be without that thought?** - Imagine yourself in the same situation, but without this belief. Who are you? How do you feel?

#### Turn it around

**Find the opposites** - Flip your original statement in different directions:

- To the opposite: "He does respect me"
- To yourself: "I don't respect myself"
- To the other person/thing: "I don't respect him"

**Find three examples** - For each turnaround that resonates, find three specific examples of how it might be as true or truer than your original thought.

**Sit with it** - Notice what shifts. You're not trying to force yourself to believe anything new. You're just making space for your mind to see things differently.

## <a id="meet-a-protector-full"></a> Meet a Protector
**Dick Schwartz, No Bad Parts**

**Context:** Parts Work (Internal Family Systems) views the mind as made up of different parts, each with its own consciousness and behavior. Sometimes these parts take over to protect us from pain or threat.

**Good for:**
- Calming intense emotions in the moment
- Understanding patterns or reactions that confuse you
- Beginning to explore your internal landscape (can lead to deeper territory)

**Spice Level:** üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è Hot

**Entry Point:** Emotions, sensations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Heads up:** This method can uncover buried emotions or painful material. It may cause volatility as old patterns surface. If something feels too big, pausing, reassessing, or seeking help is encouraged.

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 

### Steps:

**Settle in** - Find a quiet space. Let your mind settle (as much as it will).

**Notice what's present** - Observe any thoughts, emotions, sensations, or impulses. Don't judge them, just notice.

**Choose one** - Does anything seem to want your attention? Pick one to focus on.

**Locate it** - Where do you sense it in or around your body? Feel free to draw some representation of it on paper. A scribble is great.

**Check your feelings toward it** - How do you feel _towards_ this part?
   - If negative reactions show up (judgment, fear, frustration), ask those reactions to step aside for now
   - If something won't budge, work with that one instead
   - Keep going until you can approach this part with curiosity or compassion

**Talk to it like a friend** - Extend curiosity, compassion, and appreciation. Imagine you're having a conversation with someone who matters.

**On paper** - Write to it directly on the page‚Äîlike writing a letter to a friend.

**Ask and listen** - Pose these questions, then wait quietly for a response. You might not get any responses, just showing up for them is valuable
   - Is there something you want me to know?
   - What are you protecting me from?
   - Pause and recognize this part's good intention. Offer it some gratitude. Notice how it responds.
   - What do you need from me going forward?

**Close with gratitude** - Thank the part for whatever it allowed or shared, and let it know you'll check in again.
