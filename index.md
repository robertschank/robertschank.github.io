## <a id="morning-pages-full"></a> Morning Pages
[**Julia Cameron, The Artist's Way**](https://juliacameronlive.com/books-by-julia/)

**Context:** Morning Pages is a daily writing practice designed to clear mental clutter and access creativity. There's no technique to master—just write whatever comes up.

**Good for:**
- Clarity, focus
- Creativity, new ideas
- Building a regular creative practice without perfectionism or self-judgment

**Spice Level:** 🌶️ Mild

**Entry Point:** Stream of consciousness

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 

### How it works:

- **Aim for three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing**

- **Before you start your day** - Give your "monkey mind" thoughts a place to exist on the paper. Maybe they'll leave you alone.

- **Write whatever comes:** Petty complaints, to-do lists, dreams, worries, random observations. This is meant to be messy and unfiltered. It's a chance for you to accept anything your mind comes up with.

- **Keep the pen moving** - Try not to stop to edit or think. Allow your mind to slow down to match the speed of the pen, and relay whatever comes up onto the paper. If you're stuck, write about being stuck until something else emerges.

## <a id="four-questions-full"></a> Four Questions
[**Byron Katie, Loving What Is**](https://thework.com/books/)

**Context:** "The Work" explores how we suffer when our thoughts argue with reality. The four questions help you investigate those thoughts and shift your perspective.

It sounds too simple (it is simple). The practice works by slowing down enough to actually feel the difference between believing a thought and questioning it.

**Good for:**
- Relief from intrusive thoughts
- Questioning your stories
- Exploring how the internal and external reflect each other

**Spice Level:** 🌶️🌶️ Medium

**Entry Point:** Thoughts

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 

### Steps:

**Settle in** - Find a quiet space. Let your mind settle (as much as it will).

**Pick a thought** - Start by pointing your finger outward. Choose a statement about someone or something that's bothering you: "Charlie doesn't respect me,"  "My boss is unfair." Don't start with yourself ("I'm not good enough")—that comes later.

**Write it down simply** — With as few words as possible while keeping the original meaning

#### The Four Questions
1. **Is it true?** - Yes or no answers only. Sit with it for a moment if you're answering with more than a yes or a no.

1. **Can you absolutely know that it's true?** - Can you know with absolute certainty? Again, yes or no only

1. **How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?** - Notice everything. How does it feel in your body? How do you see yourself and others? What images play in your mind? 

   Stay with your original thought. If you find yourself thinking "[Original thought], *and that means _____*," you've jumped to a new thought. Come back to the first one.

1. **Who would you be without that thought?** - Imagine yourself in the same situation, but without this belief. Who are you? How do you feel?

#### Turn it around

**Find the opposites** - Flip your original statement in different directions:

- To the opposite: "He *does* respect me"
- To yourself: "*I* don't respect myself"
- To the other person/thing: "*I* don't respect *him*"

**Find three examples** - For each turnaround that resonates, find three specific examples of how it might be as true or truer than your original thought.

**Sit with it** - Notice the difference in your state between question 3 and question 4. Or take a moment with the turnarounds. Leave a little space for your mind to see things differently.

## <a id="meet-a-protector-full"></a> Meet a Protector
[**Dick Schwartz, No Bad Parts**](https://ifs-institute.com/nobadparts)

**Context:** Parts Work (Internal Family Systems) views the mind as made up of different parts, each with its own consciousness and behavior. Sometimes a strong emotion or pattern takes over. This exercise helps you step back, get curious about what's happening, and understand what it's trying to protect you from.

**Good for:**
- Calming intense emotions
- Understanding patterns or reactions
- Exploring your internal landscape

**Spice Level:** 🌶️🌶️🌶️ Hot

**Entry Point:** Emotions, sensations

<div class="how-it-works" markdown="1"> 
**⚠️ Heads up:** This method can uncover buried emotions or painful material. If something feels too big; pausing, reassessing, and seeking help is encouraged.  

<br />

### Steps:

**Settle in** - Find a quiet space. Let your mind settle (as much as it will).

**Notice what's present** - Observe any thoughts, emotions, sensations, or impulses. Don't judge them, just notice.

**Choose one** - Does anything seem to want your attention? Pick one to focus on.

**Locate it** - Where do you sense it in or around your body? Feel free to draw some representation of it on paper. A scribble is great.

**Check your feelings toward it** - How do you feel _towards_ this part?
   - If negative reactions show up (judgment, fear, anger), ask those reactions to step aside for now
   - If something won't budge, work with that one instead
   - Keep going until you can approach this part with curiosity or compassion

**Talk to it** - You can speak to this part silently, out loud, or write to it on paper. Extend curiosity, compassion, and appreciation. The idea is you're having a conversation with someone who matters.

**Ask and listen** - Pose each question below, one at a time, and wait quietly for a response. You might get clear responses, vague impressions, or nothing at all. The act of asking and listening is the practice.
   - Is there anything you'd like me to know?
   - What are you protecting me from?
   - Pause and recognize this part's good intention. Offer some gratitude. Notice how it responds.
   - What do you need from me going forward?

**Write what comes** - If images, words, or sensations arise, jot them down. Or write the whole conversation.

**Close with gratitude** - Thank the part for whatever it allowed or shared, and let it know you'll check in again.

</div>

**Modified from the original:** Writing *to* your parts, and drawing them can help along the ability to step back, observe, and interact. The original exercise in No Bad Parts could be described as closer to a meditation than a journaling method.
