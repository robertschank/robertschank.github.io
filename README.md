## Morning Pages
**Julia Cameron, The Artist's Way**

**Context:** Morning Pages is a daily writing practice designed to clear mental clutter and access creativity. There's no technique to master‚Äîjust write whatever comes out.

**Good for:**
- Getting intrusive thoughts out of your head so you can focus
- Unlocking creativity and new ideas
- Building a regular creative practice without perfectionism or self-judgment

**Heads up:** This is meant to be messy and unfiltered. No one reads these but you (not even you, ideally‚Äîjust write and move on).

**Spice Level:** üå∂Ô∏è Mild

**Entry Point:** Stream of consciousness

### How it works:

- **Aim for (In her words) "Three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning"** - Use a pen pencil writing-utensil
- 
- **First thing in the morning** - Let some thoughts out before your inner critic kicks in and micromanages the scene. Let them out and capture them on the paper.

- **Write whatever comes** - Petty complaints, to-do lists, dreams, worries, random observations, whatever

- **Aim to keep the pen moving** - Try not to stop to edit or think. Your mind may slow down to match the speed of the pen. If you get stuck, write "I don't know what to write" or whatever until something else emerges.

## Getting to Know a Protector
**Dick Schwartz, No Bad Parts**

**Context:** Parts Work (Internal Family Systems) views the mind as made up of different parts, each with its own consciousness and behavior. Sometimes these parts take over to protect us from pain or threat.

**Good for:**
- Calming intense emotions in the moment
- Understanding patterns or reactions that confuse you
- Beginning to explore your internal landscape (can lead to deeper territory)

**Heads up:** This method can uncover buried emotions or painful material. If something feels too big, pausing, reassessing, or seeking help is encouraged.

**Spice Level:** üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è Hot

**Entry Point:** Emotional, Somatic

### Steps:

1. **Settle in** - Find a quiet space. Let your mind settle (as much as it will).

2. **Notice what's present** - Observe any thoughts, emotions, sensations, or impulses. Don't judge them, just notice.

3. **Choose one** - Does anything seem to want your attention? Pick one to focus on.

4. **Locate it** - Where do you sense it in or around your body?

5. **Check your feelings toward it** - How do you feel about this part?
   - If negative reactions show up (judgment, fear, frustration), ask those reactions to step aside for now
   - If something won't budge, work with that one instead
   - Keep going until you can approach it with curiosity or compassion

6. **Talk to it like a person** - Really. Extend curiosity, compassion, appreciation. Imagine you're having a conversation with someone who matters.

7. **Ask and listen** - Pose these questions, then wait quietly for a response:
   - Is there something you want me to know?
   - What are you afraid would happen if you didn't do this?
   - What are you protecting me from?
   - Pause and recognize this part's good intention. Offer it some gratitude. Notice how it responds.
   - What do you need from me going forward?

8. **Close with gratitude** - Thank the part for whatever it shared, and let it know you'll check in again.
